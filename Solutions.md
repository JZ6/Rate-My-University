## Project Description:
Using the [Universities List API](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list) to create a website that provide a platform for students to rate their universities based on numerous factors such as: diffuclty, campus life, education.

We intend on creating a web application for students from universities around the world to rate and review ctheir universities. The API is our source for the list of universities, and also provides domains and web pages for each of the universities. 

Our page features three distinct views:
In the main page, a user types in the country of their university (autofill available), and then a list of universities of that country is fetched via jquery from our designated API, and displayed in a list of buttons beneath the "get University" button. There is also a filter box that allows you to locate a university by its name. When a user clicks on a University name button, it brings them to the second view.

In the second view:
Displays chosen unvieristy's information, overview of ratings and review. There is a button called "see more reviews", which when clicked will bring them to the third and final view.

In the third view:
Displays more detailed infromation regarding the rating out of five and where it comes from. Also displays all comments and allows users to enter their own comment and ratings. (However, we dont have a back end so this feature will be fully working in A3)

##End-User
This website is intended for currently enrolled university students as well as potential younger students who might be looking into which university they want to attend. The currently enrolled students will be able to write down reviews regarding their experiences pertaining to their own universities, while younger students will be able to view these reviews to make an educated decision as to which university they should attend to.
