## Project Description:
Using the [Universities List API](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list) to create a website that provide a platform for students to rate their universities based on numerous factors such as: diffuclty, campus life, education.

We intend on creating a web application for students from universities around the world to rate and review ctheir universities. The API is our source for the list of universities, and also provides domains and web pages for each of the universities.
