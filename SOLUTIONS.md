## Project Description:
Using the [Universities List API](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list) to create a website that provide a platform for students to rate their courses.

We intend on creating a web application for students from universities around the world to rate and review courses provided at their school. The API is our source for the list of universities, and also provides domains and web pages for each of the universities. The users will then be able to add courses specific to their university.

This API does conform to REST principles. Requests to the server are made explicitly with HTTP methods. It also does not store any information about requests that are made, hence it is stateless. The client is able to implement a cache to store that information without affecting the server. The client and server are independent of each other and can be altered without affecting the other. Each resource can be accessed with a unique URL.
